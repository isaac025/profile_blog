# My personal profile and blog website
I use HTML and CSS in order to create my website.
No JS nor PHP, just HTML and CSS.

## For the blog
The blog is still on development. But I will use Haskell.
[Servant][https://docs.servant.dev/en/stable/index.html] is a great framework
for backend and something simple as a blog is a great way to start.

## Web Server
[Hiawatha][https://www.hiawatha-webserver.org/] simple, light, secure web server.
Nginx and Apache are great but why not try new stuff!
